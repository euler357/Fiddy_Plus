Docs for the uBld.it Fiddy Plus FT2232H Board
We designed this because we got tired of getting clone chips and unnecessarily large breakout boards that were difficult to connect.  This does exactly what it is supposed to with a Genuine FTDI FT2232H high-speed IC.  All of the I/O is clearly labelled for SPI, JTAG, and UART use.  An EEPROM is on-board that can be used for setting the FT2232H into more unusual modes.
